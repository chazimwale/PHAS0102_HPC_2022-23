    "To do this, **solve the matrix-vector problem with small to medium sized value of $N$ using a range of different solvers of your choice,\n",
    "measuring factors you deem to be important for your evaluation.** These factors should include\n",
    "the time taken by the solver, and may additionally include many other things such as the number of\n",

    "**Make a set of plots that show the measurements you have made and allow you to compare the solvers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should compare at least five matrix-vector solvers: at least two of these should be iterative\n",

    "library. (You may optionally use additional solvers from other linear algebra\n",
    "libraries such as PETSc, but you do not need to do this to achieve high marks.\n",
    "You should use solvers from these libraries and do not need to implement your own solvers.)\n",

    "\n",

    "of the data from your experiments, why this is the best solver for this problem**.\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{m}_i$ is the midpoint of the $i$th square in the finite element mesh: the value of\n",
    "$u_h$ at this midpoint will be the mean of the values at the four corners of the square. For points on\n",
    "the boundary, we set $u_h=g$ and so combine evaluations of $g$ and values in the solution vector to compute some of the values in this sum.\n",

    "For a range of values of $N$ from small to large, **compute the solution to the matrix-vector\n",

    "**Make plots showing the time taken and error as $N$ is increased**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your plots, **estimate the complexity of the solver you are using** (ie is it $\\mathcal{O}(N)$?\n",
    "Is it $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$?), and **estimate the order of convergence of your solution** (your error\n",
    "should decrease like $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-\\alpha})$ for some $\\alpha>0$). Briefly (1-2 sentences)\n",
    "**comment on how you have made these estimates of the complexity and order.**\n",

    "### Part 5: parallelisation\n",
    "In this section, we will consider how your solution method could be parallelised; you do not need,\n",
    "however, to implement a parallel version of your solution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment on how your solution method could be parallelised.** Which parts (if any) would be trivial\n",
    "to parallelise? Which parts (if any) would be difficult to parallelise? By how much would you expect\n",
    "parallelisation to speed up your solution method?\n",
